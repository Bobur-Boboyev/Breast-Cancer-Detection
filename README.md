# Breast Cancer Detection with Machine Learning

This project is a breast cancer detection system that uses biopsy data to predict whether a tumor is **Malignant (M)** or **Benign (B)** using supervised machine learning models.

## Goal

To develop a reliable prediction system that can assist in early breast cancer diagnosis using clinical features obtained from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses.


## Dataset

- **Source**: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)
  

## ðŸ§  Models Used

- `Decision Tree Classifier`
- `Gradient Boosting Classifier`

a model is trained and evaluated on test data and saved using `joblib` for future predictions.
